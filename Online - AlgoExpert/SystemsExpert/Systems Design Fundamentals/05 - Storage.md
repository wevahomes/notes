# 05 - Storage

- Database:
    - Thing that serves two main purposes:
        - Store data.
        - Retrieve data.
        - Synonymous word pairs:
            - Reading / writing data.
            - Setting / getting data.
            - Recording / querying data.
- Common misconception:
    - Magical opaque box that lives somewhere in the ether.
- Really (almost always):
    - Just a server.
- Persistence:
    - Important concept.
    - Persistence of the data you store in a database.
    - People assume that if you store data and for some reason the database experiences one of the following:
        - Power outage.
        - Network issue.
        - Database crashes.
    - ... Once you turn everything back on, the data will still be there.
    - Fair, many databases mitigate for these things.
    - But, this is not always correct.
    - Leads us to two fundamental things in storage:
        - Disk.
        - Memory.
    - Writing data to disk.
        - Data will persist.
    - Writing to memory.
        - Data will not persist.
        - E.g. server code array or hash table.
        - Reading/writing here is much faster.
- Many storage/database offerings.
- A field that is broad and deep.
- Example:
    - A database can impose some sort of structure on the way the data is sorted in it.
        - E.g relational databases.
    - Availability: Uptime.
    - Distributed storage.
        - Multiple machines.
        - Consistency issues.
