# 10 - Load Balancers

- !!! BRIEF NOTES !!!

- Client - Server.
- Server: Limited resources.
- System: Limited throughput.
- Server: Too many requests: Overloaded.
    - Either:
        - Failure.
        - Slow.
- Solve: Scale!
    - Vertically scale.
        - More power.
    - Horizontally scale.
        - More servers.
- Load balancers:
    - Server sitting between clients and servers.
    - Distributes the requests.
    - Better throughput.
    - Better latencies.
    - Better use of resources.
- Load balancers: A type of reverse proxy.
- There can be many load balancers in a system.
    - Client <-> DNS server.
    - Server <-> Database.
- DNS round robin.
- Hardware load balancers.
- Software load balancers.
    - Can do more with these ones.
- You can register / deregister servers with the load balancer.
- How are requests distributed / server selection:
    - Redirect in a random order.
    - Round robin:
        - Loops though all the servers.
    - Weighted round robin.
    - Based on performance or load.
        - Load balancer performs health checks on the servers.
    - IP based server selection.
        - Hash the source IP.
        - Correspond this with a particular server.
        - Good for if server's have cacheing.
    - Path based server strategy.
        - Can update specialised servers at a time.
- Can have multiple load balancers that have different server selection strategies.
    - Layered.
- Can have more than one load balancers in one part of the system.
    - Avoid a single point of failure.
    - These load balancers can communicate between each other.
