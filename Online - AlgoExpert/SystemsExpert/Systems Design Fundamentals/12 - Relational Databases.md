# 12 - Relational Databases

- !!! BRIEF NOTES !!!

- One characterise can split databases into two categories.
- Structure imposed on the data that is sorted in the databases.
- Relational vs non-relational databases.
- Imposes a tabular-like structure.
- Data is stored in forms of tables.
    - Aka relations.
- Structures that store a bunch of data.
- Represent a particular entity.
    - Eg payments.
- Rows: Instances of the entities.
    - Aka: Records.
- Cols: Attributes of the entities.
- Defined schemas:
    - Rules on how the data is to be stored in the relational databases.
- Non-relational databases.
    - Don't impose tabular structure.
    - May still impose a structure.
    - A lot less structured though.
- Relational: Strict structure.
- Most support: SQL.
    - Structured query language.
    - Relational <-> SQL database - Used interchangeably.
    - SQL: S Q L or sequel.
- Can perform very powerful queries on the data.
    - The reason to use.
    - This business logic in code is not efficient.
- Non-relational <-> Non-SQL database.
- Non-relational databases can have their own query language.
- Relational...
- A query doesn't need to load the database into memory.
- SQL database must use ACID transactions.
    - Transaction in a database that has 4 properties:
        - Atomicity:
            - Transaction: multiple suboperations: considered to be a unit.
                - Eg transferring money.
                - If one suboperation fails, they all fail.
        - Consistently:
            - Transaction will conform to all rules of the database.
            - Any future transaction will take into account any past transaction.
        - Isolation:
            - Multiple transactions can occur at the same time.
            - But will be done as if they were done sequentially.
        - Durability:
            - When you make a transaction the effects are permanent.
- Database index:
    - Can create an additional data structure that is optimised for a particular attribute.
        - Auxiliary data structure.
    - Simplified.
    - Good for search queries.
    - Trade-off:
        - More space.
        - When you write to database, you will also write to the index.
        - Ie slower.
    - But read operations might be much faster.
- [Coding example]
    - SQL commands can be done concurrently.
    - But are done sequentially.
- Google cloud datastore:
    - Eventual consistency.
    - Data was sometimes stale.
    - This goes against ACID.
