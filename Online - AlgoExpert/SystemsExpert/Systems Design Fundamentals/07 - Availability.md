# 07 - Availability

- Need to think about latency & throughput.
- Also need to think about availability.
- How resistant a system is to failures.
    - Server failure.
    - Database failure.
    - Go down or operational?
    - How fault tolerant is a system.
- Percentage of time, in a given period of time, operational enough such that all of it primary functions are satisfied.
- Implied guarantee of availability (in this day in age).
    - So for the designers of the system, availability is very important.
- Different levels of acceptability.

    - Software to fly a plane.
- Typically measure availability as the percentage of a system's uptime in a given year.
- Up and operational for half of a year: 50% availability.
    - This is really bad. Unacceptable.
- Availability: Usually really high percentages.
- Often end up measuring availability in "nines".
    - 99%: 2 nines.
    - 99.9%: 3 nines.
    - 99.99%: 4 nines.
    - 99.999% 5 nines:
        - Gold standard.
        - High availability (HA).
- Implied guarantee of availability.
- Explicit guarantee of availability.
- Service providers have SLAs.
- Service Level Agreement (SLA):
    - Availability.
    - Amongst other things all included.
- Service Level Objective (SLO):
    - Components of a SLA.
- Not always the case that availability is super important.
    - It has trade-offs.
        - Higher latency.
        - Lower throughput.
    - What parts need it?
- How do you improve the availability of a system?
    - First and foremost:
        - Your system should not have single points of failure.
        - Need redundancy.
- E.g. 1 server:
    - Add servers and a load balancer.
    - Then will need to add more load balancers.
- Passive redundancy:
    - Multiple components in a system.
    - One dies, others take the load.
- Active redundancy:
    - Multiple machines:
    - Some do work.
    - If one of these fails.
    - Other machines will know and take over.
    - This example is called leader election.
- Want to make a system highly available:
    - Need to remove single points of failure.
    - Can do that by introducing redundancy.
- Also want to make sure you have rigorous processes in place to handle system failures.
    - May need human intervention.
    - Need processes to ensure this happens in a proper time frame.
