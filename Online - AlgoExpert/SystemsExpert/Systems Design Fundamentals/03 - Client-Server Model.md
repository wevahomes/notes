# 03 - Client-Server Model

- AKA client-server architecture.
- Client:
    - Something, a machine, that speaks to a server.
- Sever:
    - Something else, a machine, that listens to clients and then speaks back to those clients.
- The client knows that it can communicate with the "server".
- But it does not know what the server is or what it represents.
- Behind the scenes:
    - At first the client does not know how to talk to the server.
    - Makes a DNS query.
    - Finds out the IP address of the URL.
- DNS query:
    - Special request.
    - To a set of pre-determines set of servers.
    - Asks for the IP address of a URL.
- IP address:
    - A unique identifier for a machine.
- An entity will provide a machine with an IP address.
    - E.g. Google Cloud Platform.
- UNIX / Linux / MacOS:
    - Terminal:
    - `$ dig <URL>`
    - Makes a DNS request and resolves the IP address of the given URL.
- Once a browser has an IP address:
    - Sends an HTTP request to the IP address.
- An HTTP request:
    - A bunch of bytes / characters.
    - These are packed into packets (in some special format).
    - These packets are sent over to the server.
    - The request also contain the IP address of the client.
    - This is called the source address of the request. 
    - The server then will know where to send it's response.
- Ports.
- A server usually listens to requests on specific ports.
- Any machine that has a distinct IP address has 16,000 ports that programs on the machine can listen to.
- When you communicate with another machine, you need to specify what port you want to communicate on.
- Default ports for particular protocols:
    - HTTP: 80.
    - HTTPS: 443.
- UNIX: Net cat:
    - Terminal 1:
        - `nc -l 8081`.
        - `-l`: Listen.
    - Terminal 2:
        - `nc 127.0.0.1 8081`
        - `127.0.0.1`: Special IP address that always points to your own machine.
        - A communication chanel has been set up between the two.
